4. what is final keyword in java? when to use it?
Ans - final keyword is a modifier which can be apply to class , method and variable.
      1. final - variable : if we declare variable as a final then values can't be changed once it has been assign
      
      2. final - method : if we declare method as a final then that method cannot be overridden by subclasses
                          Subclasses can still inherit and use the method, but they cannot provide a different implementation.
      3. final - class  : if we declare class as a final then it cannot have any subclasses.                    
      
5. How to avoid inheritance in java ?
Ans - by declaring a class as final, you prevent it from being extended by other classes.
