29. What is Exception Handling? 
Ans-Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors 
    such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

30. What is difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked  
Ans-1) Checked Exception
       The classes which directly inherit Throwable class except RuntimeException and 
       Error are known as checked exceptions e.g. IOException, SQLException etc. 
       Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
       
    2) Unchecked Exception
       The classes which inherit RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions 
       e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. 
       Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.

31. What is the base class for Error and Exception? 
Ans-In Java, the base class for both Error and Exception classes is Throwable. 
    The Throwable class is at the top of the exception hierarchy
    
33. Is it necessary that each try block must be followed by a catch  
Ans-“No, it is not mandatory that each try block must be followed by a catch block in Java.” 
     After try block, we can use either “catch” block or “finally” block. 
     

34. What is finally block?  
Ans- used to put important codes such as clean up code 
     e.g. closing the file or closing the connection. 
     The finally block executes whether exception rise or not and whether exception handled or not.

35. Can finally block be used without catch? 
Ans-Yes, it is not mandatory to use catch block with finally.

36. What is difference between throw and throws?
Ans-
     Throw 
     1.throw is a keyword in Java which is used to throw an exception manually.
     2.Using throw keyword, you can throw an exception from any method or block. 
       But, that exception must be of type java.lang.Throwable class or it’s sub classes.

     Throws
     1.throws is also a keyword in java which is used in the method signature 
       to indicate that this method may throw mentioned exceptions.
     2.The caller to such methods must handle the mentioned exceptions either 
       using try-catch blocks or using throws keyword.
